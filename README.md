# wasm_express_template
Integrated Template of, [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) and [wasm-pack-template](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template)

**:warning: Under Construction**

#### **Note:**  Just remember, its just for practice purposes, if same kind of stuff is required by you, i have also mentioned the steps to create same structure with your own specifications.

## Discription

`mainapp` is the [wasm-pack-template](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template) that gets used if one learn **Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸** from the [docBook](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).
`myapp` is the template that gets generated by [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html), from which learning express is a bit easy.


## Wanting

I'm Trying to create template or boilerplate so that one can learn working with both the things, **wasm and express**.<br>


## Expecting 
After completion i suppose user have to just follow the following steps to use them with each other.
- User need to Write the rust code in `mainapp/src/lib.rs`
- Build that with `wasm-pack build` command
- Copy the `mainapp/pkg` to `myapp` **or** Create a `npm link` from `mainapp/pkg` to `myapp` 
- Use wasm package in express app.

## Help
Fork it, and see what you can do to help.
